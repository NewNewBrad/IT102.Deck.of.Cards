# IT102.Deck.of.Cards
Deck of cards created as objects
Using arrays and other techniques as needed, create a deck of 52 playing cards. Then devise and test a method for dealing three cards at random. After each card is dealt, the deck should have some way of tracking if the card was dealt. Demonstrate how to tell if a card is still in the deck or not.
